This project detects Parkinson's Disease using machine learning by leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models to classify patients based on biomedical voice measurements and clinical data. It incorporates PCA for feature reduction and applies optimization algorithms such as Firefly, PSO, Grasshopper, Grey Wolf, and Genetic Algorithms to enhance the performance and accuracy of both SVM and MLP models for reliable Parkinsonâ€™s disease detection.
